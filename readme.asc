= The Edinburgh Land Surface Dynamics Mixing Model

This repository holds the Edinburgh Land Surface Dynamics Mixing model, developed by Simon Mudd at the University of Edinburgh. 
It has grown out of work in collaboration with Kyungsoo Yoo at the University of Minnesota; early versions of the code appeared in papers in https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/36/1/35/129993/discrepancy-between-mineral-residence-time-and[Geology] and https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009JF001591[the Journal of Geophysical Research-Earth Surface]. 
Later versions of the model have stemmed from collaborations with Kate Maher at Stanford and Jane Willenbring at UCSD (as of yet unpublished...sorry y'all).
Louis Kinnear at Edinburgh is currently a co-developer. 

The purpose of the code is to track soil particles as they weather and accumulate cosmogenic istotopes. 

== Basic installation using docker

You can install the code using a https://www.docker.com/[Docker container]. I am afraid this preculdes use of https://bitbucket.org/crunchflow/crunchtope/wiki/Home[CRUNCHFLOW] since we don't at the moment have a working binary for the docker container. However the cosmogenic and mixing components will work. 

. Install Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
. Make a directory on your host operating system for data files. We will assume it is called something like `/LSDTopoTools` 
. Open a terminal. 
. Run lightweight docker container:
.. On Windows:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it -v C:/LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_alpine_docker
----
+
.. For MacOS or Linux:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it -v /LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_alpine_docker
----
+
.. Or if you have a different directory to LSDTopoTools data on your host machine:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it -v /PATH/TO/YOUR/DATA:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_alpine_docker
----
+
. Now clone the LSDMixing model repo:
+
[source,console]
----
# git clone https://github.com/LSDGeochemistry/LSDMixingModel.git 
----
+
. Now go into the driver function directory and make the program
+
[source,console]
----
# cd LSDMixingModel/driver_functions
# make -f mixing_model.make
----
